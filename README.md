This Addon is intended to be a simple way of showing a player what they have looted during the course of play.
The idea is to make the addon as simple as possible staying away from bloated features.
Ideally the addon itself at most would have 1 or 2 XML frames for settings or logoutput.

The minimalistic approach is to to keep the player surrounded by the world they are in and not taking focus off gameplay at anytime.
